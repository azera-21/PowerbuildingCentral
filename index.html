  <section id="about">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <h4>Powerbuilding Central was created in 2022 by everyday lifter, Ben Attwell. Ben wanted simply wanted to create place where he could share evidence-based and practical information regarding lifting and nutrition. His work is largely influenced by <a href="https://3dmusclejourney.com/">3DMJ</a>, <a href="https://renaissanceperiodization.com/">Renaissance Periodisation</a> and <a href="https://www.strongerbyscience.com/">Stronger By Science</a>, amongst many others. Ben enjoys both powerlifting and bodybuilding, and tailors his training accordingly. Ben first committed to training 7 years ago, and since has achieved a 225kg deadlift, 140kg bench press and a 160kg squat, with a trajectory to increase in the near future. Although nothing impressive by today's standards, he sees himself as just an everyday, but somewhat hardcore, lifting enthusiast and believes everybody can live up to their true physique and strenth potential!</a></h4>
