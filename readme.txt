Off-platform project from Codecademy's following their Full Stack Career Path. 

I created a home page for a fictional company, Powerlifting Central. I may even use this in the future for my own business venture / hobby.

I deployed this to GitHub Pages: https://azera-21.github.io/PowerbuildingCentral/
